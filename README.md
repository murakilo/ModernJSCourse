# ModernJSCourse
A repo to log and store my progress while taking the Udemy course 'Modern JavaScript From The Beginning' taught by Brad Traversy.

https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/

Sections 2 & 3 cover basic JS fundamentals and DOM manipulation. app.js is a long running file containing the logic for each lesson in the section as well as the comments I've made along the way to assist in my understanding of the material.

Section 4 covered 3 projects that teach how to use and manipulate the DOM - A task list application, a loan calculator application, and a number guesser game. 

Section 5 covered basic OOP principals - constructors, prototypes, inheritance, etc.
